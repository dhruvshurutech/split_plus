  # Friends API

  Endpoints for managing friendships, friend requests, and friend-specific expenses/settlements.

  ## Authentication
  All friends endpoints require Bearer token in Authorization header.

  ## Available Endpoints
  - **List Friends**: Get all accepted friends
  - **Send Friend Request**: Send a friend request to another user
  - **List Incoming Requests**: View pending friend requests received
  - **List Outgoing Requests**: View friend requests sent
  - **Accept Friend Request**: Accept an incoming friend request
  - **Decline Friend Request**: Decline an incoming friend request
  - **Remove Friend**: Remove an existing friend
  - **Create Friend Expense**: Add an expense with a friend (1-on-1)
  - **List Friend Expenses**: View expenses with a specific friend
  - **Create Friend Settlement**: Record a settlement with a friend
  - **List Friend Settlements**: View settlements with a specific friend

  ## Friend Request Flow
  1. User A sends friend request to User B (using User B's user_id)
  2. User B lists incoming requests and sees the request from User A
  3. User B accepts the request
  4. Both users can now see each other in their friends list
  5. Users can create expenses and settlements with each other

  ## Friend Expenses vs Group Expenses
  - **Friend Expenses**: Direct expenses between two friends (1-on-1)
  - **Group Expenses**: Expenses within a group context
  - Both types track payments and splits separately
