    # Groups API

    Endpoints for group management, invitations, and membership.

    ## Authentication
    All group endpoints require Bearer token in Authorization header.

    ## Available Endpoints
    - **List User Groups**: Get all groups for the authenticated user
    - **Create Group**: Create a new group (user becomes owner)
    - **Invite User**: Send invitation to join a group (owners only)
    - **Join Group**: Accept a pending invitation
    - **List Group Members**: Get all members of a specific group

    ## Workflow
    1. Create a user and save the `id` to `user_id` variable
    2. Create a group and save the `id` to `group_id` variable
    3. Create another user and save the `id` to `invite_user_id` variable
    4. Invite the second user to the group
    5. As the second user, join the group
    6. List group members to see all participants

    ## Notes
    - Group owners can invite users
    - Invited users must accept invitations to join
    - Only group members can view member lists
