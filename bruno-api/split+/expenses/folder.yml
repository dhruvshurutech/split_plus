  # Expenses API

  Endpoints for expense management, payments, and splits.

  ## Authentication
  All expense endpoints require the `X-User-ID` header with a valid user UUID.

  ## Available Endpoints
  - **List Expenses**: Get all expenses for a group
  - **Create Expense**: Create a new expense with payments and splits
  - **Get Expense**: Get expense details by ID
  - **Update Expense**: Update expense details, payments, and splits
  - **Delete Expense**: Soft delete an expense

  ## Workflow
  1. Create a group and save the `id` to `group_id` variable
  2. Create an expense with payments and splits
  3. Save the expense `id` to `expense_id` variable
  4. List expenses to see all expenses in the group
  5. Update or delete expenses as needed

  ## Notes
  - All expenses must have at least one payment (total must equal expense amount)
  - All expenses must have at least one split (total must equal expense amount)
  - Only group members can create/view expenses
  - Payments represent who paid for the expense
  - Splits represent who owes what portion of the expense
