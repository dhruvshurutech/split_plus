  - `notes` (optional): Additional notes about the expense (max 1000 characters)
  - `amount` (required): Total expense amount (must be positive)

    - `payment_method` (optional): Payment method (e.g., "cash", "card", "online")
  - `splits` (required): Array of split objects
    - `user_id` (required): UUID of the user who owes
    - `amount_owned` (required): Amount owed by this user (must be non-negative)
    - `split_type` (optional): Split type ("equal", "percentage", "fixed", "custom")

  ## Validation Rules
  - Payment amounts must total to expense amount

  - All payment and split user_ids must be group members

  ## Response
  Returns the created expense with:
  - `expense`: Expense object with id, title, amount, currency, date, etc.
  - `payments`: Array of payment objects
  - `splits`: Array of split objects

  ## Status Codes
  - `201 Created`: Expense successfully created
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid user ID
  - `403 Forbidden`: User is not a group member
  - `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Validation errors (amount mismatch, etc.)
  - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request data

  ## Notes
  - After creating an expense, copy the `id` from the response and set it as the `expense_id` environment variable.
  - Payment total must exactly equal expense amount
  - Split total must exactly equal expense amount
  - Multiple users can pay for a single expense (split payments)
