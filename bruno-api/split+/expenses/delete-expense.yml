  # Delete Expense

  Soft deletes an expense. The expense is not permanently removed but marked as deleted.

  ## Authentication
  Requires `X-User-ID` header with a valid user UUID (must be a group member).

  ## Path Parameters
  - `group_id`: UUID of the group (use `{{group_id}}` variable)
  - `expense_id`: UUID of the expense to delete (use `{{expense_id}}` variable)

  ## Response
  Returns no content (204 No Content).

  ## Status Codes
  - `204 No Content`: Expense successfully deleted
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid user ID
  - `403 Forbidden`: User is not a group member
  - `404 Not Found`: Expense not found

  ## Notes
  - This is a soft delete - the expense is marked as deleted but not removed from the database
  - Soft-deleted expenses are excluded from list queries
  - Payments and splits associated with the expense are also soft-deleted
  - Only group members can delete expenses
