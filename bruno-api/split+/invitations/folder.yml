  # Group Invitations API

  Endpoints for managing group invitations via email-based tokens.

  ## Authentication
  - **Get Invitation**: Public endpoint (no authentication required)
  - **Accept Invitation**: Requires Bearer token (user must be authenticated)
  - **Join via Invitation**: Smart endpoint (handles auth/registration internally)

  ## Available Endpoints
  - **Get Invitation**: View invitation details by token
  - **Accept Invitation**: Accept an invitation as authenticated user
  - **Join via Invitation**: Smart join (handles new user registration or existing user auth)

  ## Invitation Flow
  1. Group owner invites user by email
  2. Invited user receives email with invitation token
  3. User clicks link with token
  4. System checks if user is authenticated:
     - **If authenticated**: Automatically accept invitation
     - **If not authenticated**: Show registration/login, then auto-accept

  ## Token-based Invitations
  - Invitations are identified by unique tokens (not user IDs)
  - Tokens are time-limited and single-use
  - Users can view invitation details before accepting
