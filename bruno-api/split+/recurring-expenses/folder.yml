  # Recurring Expenses API

  Endpoints for managing recurring expenses that generate regular expense entries.

  ## Authentication
  All recurring expense endpoints require Bearer token in Authorization header.

  ## Available Endpoints
  - **List Recurring Expenses**: Get all recurring expenses for a group
  - **Create Recurring Expense**: Set up a new recurring expense
  - **Get Recurring Expense**: Get details of a specific recurring expense
  - **Update Recurring Expense**: Modify recurring expense settings
  - **Delete Recurring Expense**: Stop and remove a recurring expense
  - **Generate Expense Manually**: Manually trigger expense generation

  ## Recurring Expense Properties
  - **title**: Expense title
  - **amount**: Fixed amount for each occurrence
  - **currency_code**: Currency code
  - **repeat_interval**: "weekly", "monthly", or "yearly"
  - **day_of_month**: Day of month for monthly recurrence (1-31)
  - **day_of_week**: Day of week for weekly recurrence (0-6, Sunday=0)
  - **start_date**: When recurring expense begins
  - **end_date**: When recurring expense ends (optional)
  - **next_occurrence_date**: Next scheduled generation date
  - **is_active**: Whether the recurring expense is currently active

  ## Workflow
  1. Create a recurring expense with schedule and split details
  2. System automatically generates expenses based on schedule
  3. View generated expenses in the group's expense list
  4. Update or delete recurring expenses as needed
  5. Manually generate expenses if needed

  ## Notes
  - Recurring expenses automatically create regular expense entries
  - Each generated expense is a full expense with payments and splits
  - Generated expenses can be edited independently
  - Manual generation allows creating an expense outside the normal schedule
