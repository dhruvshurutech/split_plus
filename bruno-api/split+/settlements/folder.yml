  # Settlements API

  Endpoints for recording and managing settlements (payments between users).

  ## Authentication
  All settlement endpoints require the `X-User-ID` header with a valid user UUID.

  ## Available Endpoints
  - **Create Settlement**: Record a payment between two users
  - **List Settlements by Group**: Get all settlements in a group
  - **Get Settlement**: Get settlement details by ID
  - **Update Settlement**: Update settlement details
  - **Update Settlement Status**: Mark settlement as completed/cancelled
  - **Delete Settlement**: Soft delete a settlement

  ## Settlement Status
  - `pending`: Settlement created but not yet completed
  - `completed`: Settlement has been paid
  - `cancelled`: Settlement was cancelled

  ## Workflow
  1. View balances to see who owes whom
  2. Create a settlement to record a payment
  3. Mark settlement as completed when payment is received
  4. List settlements to see payment history

  ## Notes
  - Settlements are records of payments between users
  - Payer and payee must both be group members
  - Settlements can be marked as completed to track payment status
  - Currently, settlements don't affect balance calculations (they're separate records)
