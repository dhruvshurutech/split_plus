  ## Path Parameters

  ## Response
  Returns an array of debt objects, each containing:
  - `debtor_id`: UUID of the user who owes money
  - `debtor_email`: Email of the debtor
  - `debtor_name`: Name of the debtor
  - `creditor_id`: UUID of the user who is owed money

  - `403 Forbidden`: User is not a group member
