    # Balances API

    Endpoints for calculating and viewing balances in groups.

    ## Authentication
    All balance endpoints require Bearer token in Authorization header.

    ## Available Endpoints
    - **List Group Balances**: Get balances for all users in a group
    - **Get User Balance in Group**: Get balance for a specific user in a group
    - **Get Overall User Balance**: Get user's balances across all groups
    - **Get Simplified Debts**: Get "who owes whom" view for a group

    ## Balance Calculation
    Balance = Total Paid - Total Owed
    - Positive balance: User is owed money
    - Negative balance: User owes money

    ## Workflow
    1. Create expenses with payments and splits
    2. View group balances to see who owes whom
    3. Use simplified debts to see payment recommendations
    4. Create settlements to record payments between users

    ## Notes
    - Balances are calculated from expenses (payments and splits)
    - Settlements are separate records and don't affect balance calculations (for now)
    - All users in a group can view balances
